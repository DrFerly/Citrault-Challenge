If you desire creating plots, set the global variables in GLOBAL_VAR.py to True.
Then execute the main.py file. You can select among a few algorithms and targets, please be aware that 
SVC is very time-consuming and should therefore not be selected for local compiling, as well as the 
computing of shap values. However regarding the shap values for a pure plotting purpose, a possible 
workaround is to reduce the train/test ratio to 0.005. Formodel metrics and training, please do not 
forget to switch back to a reasonable test/train ratio.


Enjoy!
